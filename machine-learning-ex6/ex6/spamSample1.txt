Kubernetes is now the standard open source platform to automate the management and scaling of modern, containerized applications. As businesses adopt cloud native microservice architectures, Kubernetes serves as the orchestrator to increase application availability, scalability, and portability—while also lowering costs. 

We’re excited to announce the availability of DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOK8s), a powerfully simple managed Kubernetes service.
